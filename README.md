## Description
This Bash script provides a simple interface to perform cracking operations using Hashcat. It offers various options such as cracking with wordlists, rules, brute-force, and hybrid wordlist + mask attacks. The program is enriched with comments in order to make it as usable and minimal as possible. To download it just go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/ente0v1/Crack_Master/releases).

## Features
- Crack passwords using wordlists, rules, or brute-force methods.
- Perform hybrid attacks combining wordlists and masks.
- Easy-to-use menu interface for selecting cracking options.
- Supports session restoration for interrupted cracking sessions.

## Requirements
- OS: Linux, Windows 10 or later
- Programs: [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) and [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (if you are a Windows user)
- Resources: Wordlists, rules, and masks available in the specified paths

## Installation
**Command to clone (lightweight) repo**
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ente0v1/Crack_Master.git
cd Crack_Master
```

- If you are on Windows, in order to execute Bash, simply download [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or [Kali Linux](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pkr34tncv07?hl=en-us&gl=US) from Microsoft Store.
To begin, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/ente0v1/Crack_Master.git` in your $HOME directory, then navigate into the Crack_Master folder by typing `cd Crack_Master`. Proceed to move `hash.txt` in your repo root directory. 

- If you want to set default values, such as wordlists and rules comment `define_default_parameters` and uncomment `define_my_parameters` (in files suffixed with `crack-*`, finally go change variables in function "define_my_parameters" in `functions.sh`.

- To populate Crack_Master with wordlists and such, just execute:
```
cd Crack_Master
git clone https://github.com/ente0v1/hashcat-defaults
cd hashcat-defaults/
mv * ../Crack_Master
```

With these steps completed, you're now ready to run the script by executing `./crackmaster.sh`.

If you want to download new wordlists see [wordlists.txt](./wordlists.txt).

To implement Hashcat for Windows see [Hashcat Build Documentation](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/BUILD.md) and refer to the [Official Homepage](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/).

## Usage

**Capturing a WPA2 hash**

In order to sniff EAPOL packets in the [4-way-handshake](https://notes.networklessons.com/security-wpa-4-way-handshake) see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfYxrLaqlN8).
The commands shown in the video has been put in the folder `scripts`.

**Cracking the password**

To start the script log in as non-root user and rename your hash in `hash.txt`, move your hash into `Crack_Master` directory and execute: `./crackmaster.sh`.

At the end of the cracking you will see the results inside `logs`, just open `status.txt` in the session folder.

## Script Breakdown
The `crack-rule.sh` script do password cracking using a combination of a wordlist and a set of rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**Initialization**
  - Loads functions from a separate file (`functions.sh`), containing reusable functionalities used throughout the script.
  - Sets default values for various parameters like script paths, session names, wordlists, and rules.
  - Checks for existing restore files (potentially from previous cracking sessions) in a designated directory. If any are found, it lists their names.
  - Prompts the user to choose a restore file to resume an earlier session (optional).

**User Interaction**
  - Asks the user to define a name for the current cracking session (with a default option).
  - Prompts the user for the directory containing wordlists (with a default option).
  - Lists available wordlist files within the specified directory.
  - Asks the user to select a specific wordlist from the available ones (with a default option).
  - Prompts the user to choose a rule file containing password cracking rules (with a default option).
  - Optionally asks the user if they want to update screen every 2 seconds during cracking (showing progress updates).

**Command Construction and Display**
  - Constructs the actual hashcat command to be executed based on the user's choices and script defaults. This command defines various parameters for the cracking process.
  - Displays the constructed hashcat command for the user to review the cracking configuration.

**Hashcat Execution**
  - Checks the user's decision about the status timer.
  - If the user opted for a timer ("y"), the script executes hashcat with --status --status-timer=2 options. These options provide real-time updates on the cracking progress.
  - Otherwise, hashcat is executed without the status timer.

**Saving Results**
  - Calls a function named save_settings (defined in `functions.sh`). This function stores details about the successful cracking session, such as the session name, chosen wordlist path and name, rule name, etc.
  - Calls another function named save_logs (defined in `functions.sh`). This function organizes and saves data and logs generated during the cracking process.

## Cracking options in-depth
**Menu Options workflow**

Here's a detailed explanation on how code is made:
1. Hybrid Wordlist + Mask Cracking:
  - This script specifically handles cracking with a combination of a wordlist and a mask.
  - The mask allows generating variations of words from the wordlist using placeholders like ?a?a?a which represent characters.

2. User Prompts and Inputs:
  - The script retrieves available sessions for potential restoration.
  - It prompts the user for various inputs:
    - Restore file name (optional)
    - Session name (defaults to $default_session)
    - Wordlist path (defaults to $default_wordlists)
    - Wordlist name (defaults to $default_wordlist)
    - Mask (defaults to $default_mask)
    - Whether to use a status timer (prompts for "y" or "n")
    - Minimum password length (defaults to $default_min_length)
    - Maximum password length (defaults to $default_max_length)
  
3. Hashcat Command Construction:
  - The script constructs the hashcat command based on user inputs and default values.
  - Here's a breakdown of the important options:
    - --session="$session": Creates or resumes a session named $session
    - --increment --increment-min="$min_length" --increment-max="$max_length": Enables password length incrementing within the specified range.
    - -m 22000: Specifies the hash mode (for a specific hash type)
    - hash: Path to the hash file containing the password hash
    - -a 6: Sets the attack mode to hybrid wordlist + mask (mode 6)
    - -w 4: Sets workload of cracking devices. See `hashcat -I`
    - --outfile-format=2: Specifies output format for cracked passwords
    - -o plaintext.txt: Output file for cracked passwords
    - "$wordlist_path/$wordlist": Path to the chosen wordlist
    - "mask": The mask string to generate password variations

4. Conditional Hashcat Execution:
  - The script checks the user's choice for a status timer:
    - If "y", it executes hashcat with --status --status-timer=2 options, providing real-time status updates every 2 seconds.
    - Otherwise, it executes hashcat without the status timer.

5. Saving Results:
  - The script calls save_settings to store details about the successful cracking session (session name, wordlist path, wordlist name, mask, etc.).
  - It calls save_logs to organize and store session data and logs.

## Useful one-liners for wordlist manipulation (from [wpa2-wordlists](https://github.com/kennyn510/wpa2-wordlists.git))
Remove duplicates:
```
awk '!(count[$0]++)' old.txt > new.txt
```
Sort by length:
```
awk '{print length, $0}' old.txt | sort -n | cut -d " " -f2- > new.txt
```
Sort by alphabetical order:
```
sort old.txt | uniq > new.txt
```
Merge multiple text files into one:
```
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
```
Remove all blank lines:
```
egrep -v "^[[:space:]]*$" old.txt > new.txt
```
